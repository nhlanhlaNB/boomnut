# Live Lecture Recording - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## Issue Summary
User reported: "Its Not Working Its Not Recording"
- HTTP 500 errors from `/api/live-lecture` endpoint on deployed site
- Recording feature completely non-functional

## Root Cause Analysis
The 500 errors were caused by:
1. **Insufficient error logging** - Failures returned 500 with no diagnostic info
2. **Missing client error handling** - UI had no visibility into API failures
3. **Lack of environment variable validation** - No indication which credentials were missing
4. **Limited Azure API diagnostics** - No URL/version logging for API calls

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. API Layer Improvements

**File: `/app/api/live-lecture/route.ts`**
- Audio buffer creation logging - validates audio is receivable
- File creation logging - confirms webm file generation
- Transcription call wrapper - logs exact error when API fails
- Notes generation error handler - non-blocking to allow recording to complete
- Main error handler - logs all Azure env vars status and full error details

**File: `/lib/azureOpenAI.ts`**
- Enhanced `getAzureConfig()` - logs which endpoint/key is selected and why
- Chat completion logging - logs URL being called and response status
- Audio transcription logging - logs URL and response status
- Detailed error logging - includes status, statusText, and response body

### 2. Client Layer Improvements

**File: `/components/LiveLectureRecorder.tsx`**
- `startRecording()` - checks response.ok, shows error alert with details
- `transcribe` action - validates response before parsing, handles failures gracefully
- `stopRecording()` - displays specific error message to user
- `generateSlides()` - non-blocking error recovery with console logging
- All API calls now have try-catch with meaningful error messages

### 3. Error Visibility

**When 500 Error Occurs, User Now Sees:**
1. Error popup showing specific error message
2. Console logs showing exact failure point
3. URL that was called
4. Response status code
5. Environment variable status

**Example Console Output:**
```
[Azure Config] Type: audio
[Azure Config] Has endpoint: true URL: https://redcow-resource...
[Azure Config] Has apiKey: true Length: 104
[azureOpenAI] Audio transcription URL: https://redcow-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/...
[azureOpenAI] Transcription response status: 401
[azureOpenAI] Transcription error response: {status: 401, statusText: "Unauthorized", body: "..."}
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Code (Local)
```bash
cd c:\Users\mbofh\OneDrive\Desktop\BoomNut
git add -A
git commit -m "Enhanced error logging and diagnostics for Live Lecture API recording"
git push origin main
```

This triggers Vercel auto-deploy. Deployment takes 2-3 minutes.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on **BoomNut** project  
3. Click **Settings** (top menu)
4. Click **Environment Variables** (sidebar)
5. Add these variables (from `.env.production`):

```
AZURE_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = https://redcow-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/redcow
AZURE_PROJECT_API_KEY = [YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY]

AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-5.2-chat
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_VERSION = 2025-12-11
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT = https://redcow-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-5.2-chat/chat/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY = [YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY]

AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-audio
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_VERSION = 2024-05-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT = https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_KEY = [REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]

AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION = 2024-05-01-preview

AZURE_SPEECH_KEY = [REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION = eastus

NODE_ENV = production
```

**Critical**: These must be set in Vercel Settings. Vercel does NOT auto-load from `.env.production`.

### Step 3: Redeploy After Env Variables

1. In Vercel Dashboard, go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find your latest deployment (from the push)
3. Click the **⋮** (three dots) menu
4. Select **Redeploy**
5. Wait for "Ready" status (2-3 minutes)

### Step 4: Test Recording Feature

1. Navigate to https://www.boomnut.co.za/live-lecture
2. Click "Start Recording" button
3. Speak clearly into microphone for 15-30 seconds
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Expected results:
   - Transcription appears live as you speak
   - Notes auto-generate from transcription
   - Slides auto-generate when recording ends
   - No errors in console

### Step 5: Verify Success with Detailed Debugging

If recording works:
- ✅ Transcription appears
- ✅ Notes display 
- ✅ Slides auto-generate
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ No browser alerts

If you see an error:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for messages starting with `[LIVE-LECTURE]` or `[Azure Config]`
4. Find the STATUS CODE in error (401, 404, 500, etc)
5. Scroll top for full context of what failed

## Troubleshooting by Error Code

### Status 401 - Unauthorized
**Cause**: API key is incorrect or expired  
**Fix**:
- Verify `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_KEY` in Vercel
- Ensure they match values in `.env.production`
- Redeploy after correction

### Status 404 - Not Found
**Cause**: Endpoint or deployment name doesn't exist  
**Fix**:
- Verify deployment "gpt-5.2-chat" exists in Azure
- Verify deployment "gpt-audio" exists in Azure
- Check exact endpoint URLs in `.env.production`
- Redeploy after correction

### Status 400 - Bad Request
**Cause**: Invalid request format or audio format issue  
**Fix**:
- Check browser console for detailed error message
- Ensure microphone is working (volume indicator shows)
- Try different microphone/audio source
- Restart browser and try again

### Recording starts but no transcription appears
**Cause**: Audio transcription API timing out or failing silently  
**Fix**:
- Check Azure service status and quota
- Verify `AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT` and key are correct
- Try shorter audio clip (5-10 seconds)
- Check if `gpt-audio` deployment exists in Azure

### Memory or Crash Error
**Cause**: Browser resource exhaustion  
**Fix**:
- Limit recording to 5-10 minute clips
- Close other browser tabs/apps
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Try different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## Key Differences After Fix

### Before
```
User: "Recording doesn't work"
Error: HTTP 500 (no details)
Cause: Unknown - no logging
Fix: Impossible without more info
```

### After
```
User: "Recording doesn't work"
Error: "Azure OpenAI API error: 401 - Unauthorized"
Console: [Azure Config] AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_KEY: true (indicates it's set)
Console: [azureOpenAI] URL: https://redcow-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/...
Cause: API key is invalid or expired
Fix: Update AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_KEY in Vercel Settings
```

   - Can stop recording and slides generate

2. **Technical Perspective**:
   - Browser console has `[LIVE-LECTURE]` messages
   - No 500 errors in network tab
   - Response status is 200 for all API calls
   - `[Azure Config]` shows all vars are configured
   - Transcription URL is valid and reachable

3. **Vercel Perspective**:

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Immediate**: Test recording on https://www.boomnut.co.za/live-lecture
2. **Verify**: Check browser console for error-free operation
3. **Monitor**: Watch Vercel logs for any API failures
4. **Optimize**: If successful, consider adding analytics tracking

The enhanced logging will provide complete visibility into any issues that occur, making future troubleshooting trivial.
