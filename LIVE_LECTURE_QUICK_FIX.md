## 🔧 What YOU Need to Do (REQUIRED FOR FIX TO WORK)

### STEP 1: Deploy Code Changes
- [ ] Run `git add -A && git commit -m "Live Lecture error fixes"` locally
- [ ] Run `git push origin main` to push to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel auto-deploy will start automatically

### STEP 2: Set Azure Credentials in Vercel (CRITICAL!)
1. [ ] Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. [ ] Click on **BoomNut** project
3. [ ] Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. [ ] Add these variables from your `.env.production` file:
```
AZURE_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project
AZURE_PROJECT_API_KEY=[REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-chat
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4-chat/chat/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY=[REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-audio
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_KEY=[REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-05-01-preview
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=[REDACTED - Use your actual key from Azure]
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your-region
NODE_ENV=production
```
5. [ ] Click "Save" for each variable

### STEP 3: Redeploy After Adding Variables
1. [ ] Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. [ ] Find the latest deployment (from your push)
3. [ ] Click **⋮ (three dots)** → **Redeploy**
4. [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (should show "Ready")

### STEP 4: Test Recording
1. [ ] Go to https://www.boomnut.co.za/live-lecture
2. [ ] Click "Start Recording" button
3. [ ] Speak for 10-20 seconds
4. [ ] Click "Stop Recording"
5. [ ] Check if transcription appears

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If You See "Failed to start recording" Alert:
- [ ] Check browser console (F12 → Console)
- [ ] Look for message about "Azure AI Project credentials"
- [ ] Go back to STEP 2 and verify all env variables are set
- [ ] Make sure you clicked "Save" for each one
- [ ] Redeploy in Vercel

### If Transcription Never Appears:
- [ ] Check browser console for specific error
- [ ] Look for `[LIVE-LECTURE]` messages
- [ ] Look for `[Azure Config]` messages
- [ ] Screenshot the error and note the error code (401, 404, etc)

### If You See Error Code 401:
- [ ] API key is incorrect or expired
- [ ] Verify API key in `.env.production` matches what's in Vercel
- [ ] Redeploy

### If You See Error Code 404:
- [ ] Endpoint URL or deployment name doesn't exist
- [ ] Verify exact URLs match between `.env.production` and Vercel
- [ ] Check Azure portal that deployments still exist
